# Thesis
An adaptive system for estimating traffic light duration using computer vision and fuzzy logic algorithms. This project utilizes object detection with YOLOv9 and a fuzzy logic system designed in Matlab and implemented in Python to recommend optimal traffic light durations based on vehicle density.
